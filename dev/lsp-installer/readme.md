# What?

This script is a simple way to me to auto update the LSP servers I have on my Debian machine.

I used the [Amber language](https://amber-lang.com) to generate the [Bash script](https://github.com/Mte90/My-Scripts/blob/master/dev/lsp-installer/install.sh) version from the [Amber version](https://github.com/Mte90/My-Scripts/blob/master/dev/lsp-installer/install.ab)

Next I used [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) to beautify the bash code, Amber has a [PR to integrate it automatically](https://github.com/Ph0enixKM/Amber/pull/128).

The Amber language is new so I used that example to test it and report various issues on the Base code generated that can be improved.
